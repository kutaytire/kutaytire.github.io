I’m a Ph.D. student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at UT Austin, advised by [Prof. Sujay Sanghavi] and [Prof. Haris Vikalo]. My research focuses on on the applications
and theoretical foundations of deep learning, time-series analysis, LLMs, and optimization.
Previously, I received a B.S. in Computer Science and Physics with a double major from Bilkent University, where I was advised by [Prof. Eray Tüzün]. I also had the opportunity to collaborate with [Prof. Samet Oymak] as a summer research intern at the University of Michigan, where we worked on applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to time-series forecasting.
